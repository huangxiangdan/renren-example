=============================================
renren is a minimalistic API implementation, where all function calls goes through a single method. For example to publish a feed item one might do the following:

  param = {:method, "feed.publishFeed", :name, "foo", :description, "bar", :url, "http://jihua.fm"}
  renren = Renren::Base.new(token)
  renren.call_method(param)

You can use Omniauth-renren to get token.
